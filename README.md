# Coding Keiko

A place where to practice Kata.

## Common rules

- Suppose to consume the time of participant within an hour.
- Do as either Driver(a person who actually types keyboard) or Navigator(who actually think about the problem and navigate Driver what code to type)
- Switch roles of each other per 20minuets
- When do roles both Driver and Navigator respectively, then we start retrospective of the practice
- If the problem needs some preparation of codes, @kogai will add those to [the repository](https://github.com/kogai/coding-keiko)
- Problems are generally picked up from `Kata Catalogue` section of [The Coding Dojo Handbook](https://leanpub.com/codingdojohandbook)
